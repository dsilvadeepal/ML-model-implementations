# ML-model-implementations
Various Machine Learning model implementations in R

## Classification
- [x] Logistic Regression
- [x] Decision Tree
- [x] Random Forests
- [x] XG Boost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- [x] Naive Bayes
- [x] Support Vector Model(SVM)
- [x] K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN)

## Regression
- [ ] Simple Linear
- [ ] Multiple Linear
- [ ] Regression Trees
- [ ] Support Vector Regression (SVR)

## Clustering
- [ ] K-Means
- [ ] Hierarchial

## Tuning & Understanding the Model (stats & maths)
- [ ] Evaluation metrics
  * Accuracy and Kappa
  * RMSE and R^2
  * ROC (AUC, Sensitivity and Specificity)
  * LogLoss
- [ ] Hyperparameter Tuning for each model


## Artificial Neural Networks  (need to research more on this - especially the R packages for it or if I need to brush up my Python skills)
- [ ] MLP
- [ ] RNN
- [ ] CNN
